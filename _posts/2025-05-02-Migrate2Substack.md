I’ve decided to move my scribbles, sketches, and semi-coherent thoughts over to Substack. It’s a bit cosier there, and frankly, a better place for the sort of things I like to write (and you hopefully like to read).

All future posts will live here: [Substack link](https://nickshoh.substack.com/) — come say hi, and subscribe if you're keen.
