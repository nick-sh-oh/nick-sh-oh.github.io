Hi there! I'm Nick (Seungheon) Oh - a **social scientist fascinated by the intersection of artificial intelligence and the social sciences**. My research explores how AI can enhance the work of social scientists in explaining complex real-world phenomena.

I'm particularly interested in pioneering methods that leverage AI techniques like [natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) and [deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) to uncover insights in data that are invisible to human analysis alone. My goal is to develop interpretable AI models that don't just predict outcomes, but also elucidate the underlying _hows_ and _whys_ that drive socio-political-economic events.

After studying [Politics and Economics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/undergraduate/degree-programmes-2024/bsc-politics-and-economics) at the [London School of Economics and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/), I started my career as a junior NLP engineer at Numen Capital. I now lead the development of open-source AI models and toolkits as Principal Researcher at [socius](https://www.socius.org/) to empower social scientists with optimized resources for analyzing socio-politico-economic data.

I believe the future of social science lies in thoughtfully harnessing the strengths of both human and artificial intelligence. Please feel free to reach out if you ever want to chat more about the fascinating intersections between the two!
