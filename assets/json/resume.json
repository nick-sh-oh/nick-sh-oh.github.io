This resource empowered social scientists with tailored lexicons to conduct more insightful sentiment analysis. \n* Developed RedditHarbor, a toolkit enabling easy large-scale collection of Reddit data. Storing the data in Supabase made it conveniently accessible to researchers. This resource expanded social scientists' data sources for quantitative and qualitative analysis. \n* Architected Sentium, an interpretable rule-based sentiment analysis model with state-of-the-art performance on social science text. The model's explainability helps researchers derive impactful insights from sentiment analysis.",

In particular, he used the idea of light quanta (photons) to explain experimental results, but stressed the importance of the experimental results. The importance of his work on the photoelectric effect earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921."
