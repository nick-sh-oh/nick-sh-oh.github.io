This analysis led to accurate forecasts of market movements, directly assisting quantitative investment strategies.","highlights":["NLP"]},{"name":"socius","position":"Principal Researcher","url":"https://socius.org","startDate":"2023-01","summary":"socius is an AI research lab endorsed by the London School of Economics creating open-source models and data to empower social scientists. \n* Lead developer of sentibank, a large-scale open database consolidating 15 original and 43 processed sentiment dictionaries spanning diverse genres and domains. This resource empowered social scientists with tailored lexicons to conduct more insightful sentiment analysis. \n* Developed RedditHarbor, a toolkit enabling easy large-scale collection of Reddit data. Storing the data in Supabase made it conveniently accessible to researchers. This resource expanded social scientists' data sources for quantitative and qualitative analysis. \n* Architected Sentium, an interpretable rule-based sentiment analysis model with state-of-the-art performance on social science text. The model's explainability helps researchers derive impactful insights from sentiment analysis.","highlights":["NLP"]}],"education":[{"institution":"London School of Economics and Political Science","location":"London, UK","url":"https://www.lse.ac.uk/","area":"Politics and Economics","studyType":"BSc","startDate":"2016-09-22","endDate":"2020-07-09","score":"Upper Second Class","courses":["Macroeconomic Principles","Microeconomic Principles I","Public Choice and Politics","Research Design in Political Science","Monetary Economics","Applied Quantitative Methods for Political Science","Algorithms and Programming","Game Theory I","Politics of Money and Finance in Comparative Perspective"]},{"institution":"University of London","location":"London, UK","url":"https://www.london.ac.uk/","area":"Data Science and Artificial Intelligence","studyType":"MSc","startDate":"2022-04-26","endDate":"2023-12-22","score":"Distinction","courses":["Big data analysis","Data programming in Python","Statistics and statistical mining","Machine learning","Data science research topics","Mathematics of financial markets","Artificial intelligence","Natural language processing","Neural networks","Social media and network science"]}],"certificates":[{"name":"Big Data to Decisions: AI and Machine Learning","date":"2019-03-11","issuer":"London Business School","url":"https://www.london.edu/","icon":"fa-solid fa-location-dot"}],"publications":[{"name":"sentibank: A Unified Resource of Sentiment Lexicons and Dictionaries","publisher":"International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media","releaseDate":"2024","url":"https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/31443","summary":"Sentiment analysis is critical across computational social science domains, but faces challenges in interpretability.
